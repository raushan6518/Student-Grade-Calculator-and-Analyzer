# Project Statement: Student Grade Calculator and Analyzer

## 1. Problem Statement

Students at VIT University face challenges in accurately calculating and tracking their academic performance throughout their degree program. The manual calculation of SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is time-consuming, prone to errors, and makes it difficult for students to plan their future academic strategy. There is a need for an automated system that can efficiently manage grade calculations, provide academic insights, and help students set realistic academic goals.

## 2. Project Overview

The **Student Grade Calculator and Analyzer** is a Python-based application designed to automate the process of calculating and analyzing student academic performance according to VIT University's grading system. The system provides comprehensive features for grade management, performance tracking, and academic planning.
